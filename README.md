# Event Scheduler / Flexible Calendar

Hosted [here](https://xenodochial-jepsen-167844.netlify.app/). 

This project is a customizable calendar designed for displaying events that overlap in time.

The user can specify the calendar's range, setting the start date, start time, number of days, and day length. The user can then place events that occur in the specified time range, where they will be automatically arranged to fit around each other. The calendar can display up to twelve simultaneous events. 



For demonstration purposes, this version of the project uses local storage. A version of the project that uses a RESTful API can be found [here](https://github.com/EmilyLow/event-scheduler-frontend).
